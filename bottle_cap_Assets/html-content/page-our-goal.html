						<h2>Build a Brighter Future, One Line of Code at a Time</h2>
						<p>Welcome to Thorium90, a CMS forged in the digital wastelands, where the art of coding is the ultimate survival skill. Just as the GECK (Garden of Eden Creation Kit) was designed to rebuild the world after the bombs fell, our mission is to help you rebuild <span class="fw-bold">(or start building)</span> your skillset from the ground up, one keystroke at a time.</p>

						<h2>What We Aim to Achieve</h2>
						<ul>
							<li><span class="fw-bold">Teach People How to Code from the Ground Up</span><br />Whether you're stepping out of your Vault for the first time or a seasoned developer scavenging for knowledge, Thorium90 guides you through the irradiated ruins of PHP, SQL, and more. No shortcuts, no handholding, just real-world coding skills for building applications from scratch.</li>
							<li><span class="fw-bold">Make the Tools Easy to Use</span><br />Like your trusty Pip-Boy, Thorium90 is intuitive and reliable. It's designed to work seamlessly, letting you focus on building instead of wrestling with convoluted systems while still learning to write code</li>
							<li><span class="fw-bold">Self-Documenting for Skill Growth</span></br />Just as every entry in your Vault Log chronicles your journey, Thorium90 incourages self-documentation as you progress. By the end, you'll have a clear roadmap of what you've learned and built, ready to tackle even the most complex wasteland challenges.</li>

						<h2>Skills You'll Gain in the Wasteland</h2>
						<ul>
							<li><span class="fw-bold">Learn to Write Actual PHP Code</span><br />Thorium90 teaches you the mechanics of PHP, the backbone of modern web applications, so you're not just a scavenger plugging in pre-built modules, you're a true wasteland coder.</li>
							<li><span class="fw-bold">Understand SQL at its Core</span><br />No more relying on pre-chewed database queries. Learn how to write raw SQL to organize and manipulate data as efficiently as a Vault-Tec Overseer.</li>
							<li><span class="fw-bold">Master Organization to Minimize Duplication</span></br />Avoid the chaos of repeating yourself (and your code). With Thorium90, you'll learn to organize your application with the precision of a Brotherhood of Steel Scribe ensuring every resource is used to its fullest potential.</li>
							<li><span class="fw-bold">Learn how AI can give you Superpowers</span></br />Just as Power Armor gives you an edge against a Deathclaw, using AI as your expert guide can give you superhuman efficiency. Ask AI to optimize a function or sql query. Get insight on CSS changes and how best to implement them. Keep your favorite AI tool right by your side just like your trusted Pip-Boy.</li>
