## Vault-Tec Presents: Laravel Survival Kit v76

Are you tired of wandering the barren wasteland of web development, scavenging for scraps of code to build your next project? Look no further, vault dweller! Vault-Tec is proud to present the Laravel Survival Kit v76 - your one-stop shop for post-apocalyptic web application needs!

### What's in the Box?

- Laravel 11 (Because 10 just wasn't rad enough)
- PHP 8.2 (Mutated for maximum performance)
- Bootstrap 5.3 (For when you need your mutations to look good)

### Features That'll Make You S.P.E.C.I.A.L

1. **User Management**: Keep track of your vault dwellers or super mutants. We don't judge.
2. **Blog Functionality**: Share your adventures, or warn others about that Deathclaw nest you found.
3. **Page Builder**: Construct pages faster than you can say "Another settlement needs your help!"

### Installation

1. Clone this repo faster than a Radroach steals your Nuka-Cola:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/laravel-survival-kit-v76.git
   ```

2. Enter the vault:
   ```
   cd laravel-survival-kit-v76
   ```

3. Install dependencies (no Bobbleheads required):
   ```
   composer install
   npm install
   ```

4. Set up your .env file. Don't worry, it's easier than hacking a terminal in Fallout:
   ```
   cp .env.example .env
   php artisan key:generate
   ```

5. Migrate your database. It's like moving to a new Vault, but less radioactive:
   ```
   php artisan migrate
   ```

6. Launch the nukes... I mean, the server:
   ```
   php artisan serve
   ```

### Contributing
