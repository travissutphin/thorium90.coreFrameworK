# Your radioactive web core: Mutate your apps faster than a Radroach on Nuka-Cola!

## Welcome to the Wasteland of Web Development! 🚀☢️
### Vault-Tec Presents: Web Survival Kit v76

Are you tired of wandering the barren wasteland of web development, scavenging for scraps of code to build your next project? Look no further, vault dweller! Vault-Tec is proud to present the **Web Survival Kit v76** - your one-stop shop for post-apocalyptic web application needs!

## What's in the Box?
- **Custom Framework** (Built for maximum adaptability, mutation, and improvement)
- **PHP 8.2** (Mutated for maximum performance)
- **Bootstrap 5.3** (For when you need your mutations to look good)

## Features That'll Make You S.P.E.C.I.A.L
- **User Management**: Keep track of your vault dwellers or super mutants. We don't judge.
- **Blog Functionality**: Share your adventures, or warn others about that Deathclaw nest you found.
- **Page Builder**: Construct pages faster than you can say "Another settlement needs your help!"
- **Store**: Sell your wares, from stimpaks to super mutant repellent.
- **Table Templating System**: Designed for better table views, automatically morphing into card layouts on mobile.

## Nomenclature Outline (For the Nerds Who Survived)
Because consistency is key in a wasteland full of spaghetti code:
- **Functions**: Self-documenting using `verb_FunctionName`] syntax (e.g., `read_Users()` or `calculate_totals_Store()` or `update_Page` - not the use of capital for function name.
- **Variables**: Self-documenting (e.g., `$dsp_` to display variable).
- **Files**:
  - Core functions live in `/rad_Modules/` including config, database and helpers
  - All models live in `/pip_boy_MVC/fusion_core_Models/` the broken down per function `blog.function.php` or `store.function.php`
  - Themes and UI enhancements reside in `/pip_boy_MVC/wasteland_Views/` the broken down per section. `blog` or `store`
  - All controllers live in `/pip_boy_MVC/overlord_Controllers/` then broken down per controller `blog.controller.php` or `store.controller.php`
  - All mutants (a.k.a. third-party packages) are stored in `/mutants/`
  - Assets `/bottle_cap_Assets/`
     -  `images` - global website images for headers etc.
     -  `css` - for css files
     -  `js` - for javasript file
